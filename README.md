# Personal-Project-Website
I used HTML and CSS to start making a website for my mom (she's a high school teacher)

I started making a website for my mom over one of my breaks from school in 2017 and I periodically went back and added some components.
I realized a couple of weeks in that she wouldn't be able to make changes as easily as she would like so she never ended up using it and I didn't finish; however, I did learn alot about HTML and CSS. It was my first attempt at using the two languages and I learned everything
that I used through about 60 youtube videos. I don't have any formal educaction about web design but I think it's interesting and fun
and I can learn on my own by using resources online.
